Design for Software Color Code Samples
=======
These samples demonstrate ways to programmatically generate color palettes and how to work with color to do some fun things in code. The two samples include:


* **Find Average Color** - This sample show how to pull the average color from an image programmatically. 
* **Genereate Monochromatic Color Palettes**  -  This sample shows how to generate a monochrome color palette based on a single color value.

How do I run the samples?
-------

This sample code is not meant to be used in any production environment. They are code experiments demonstrating basic functionality. That being said, you can follow these basic instructions to run the samples.

1.	Ready the code	⁃	You must host the "Find Average Color" sample on a web server before it will render properly. This is due to cross-site domain accessibility issues. 	

2.	Run the sample	⁃	Open the index.html file in a modern browser to run the samples. 
3.	Experiment	- The whole point of these samples if to provide you with a jump start to extend and modify these code samples for your own projects.  Have Fun!


Additionally, these samples and other can be seen live and downloaded from

Enjoy!
